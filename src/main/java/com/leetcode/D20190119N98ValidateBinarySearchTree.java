/**
 * Given a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).
 *
 * Assume a BST is defined as follows:
 *
 * The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
 * The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
 * Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
 *
 * 1.中序遍历：InOrder 左根右 升序
 * 2.递归
